        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a third year Computer Science student at West Chester University of Pennsylvania.
            I have been programming for three years, and through my high school and college careers I
            have stregthened skills mainly in Object Oriented Programming (Java, C#) but I have also
            been exposed to database management (SQL) and web development (HTML, CSS) technologies.
            I am currently in search of an internship for Summer 2021.
            Outside of the classroom, I am most passionate about performing and teaching music.
